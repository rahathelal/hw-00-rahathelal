## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(scico) # for color palette 
library(DT) # for interactive table 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio.png")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/quarto.png")
```

```{r}
# install the package
# only needs to be done once on your machine
# better put all the installation stuff in the setup chunk
# install.packages("readr")

# load the package
# needs to be done every time you come back to working on the project
library(readr)

un_votes <- read_csv("data/un_votes.csv")
```

```{r}
nrow(un_votes) # number of rows
ncol(un_votes) # number of columns
dim(un_votes) # rows columns together (Roller Coaster)
colnames(un_votes)
```

```{r}
# -- [MRH] Provide the total number of fields in the file/dataset 
length(colnames(un_votes))
```

```{r}
colnames(un_votes) |> 
  length() # return the length of this vector

un_votes |> 
  colnames() |> # get column names vector
  length() # return the length of this vector
```

```{r}
head(un_votes)
tail(un_votes, n = 10)
```

```{r}
summary(un_votes)
```

```{r}
glimpse(un_votes)
```

```{r}
un_votes$issue |>
  unique()
```

```{r}
# [MRH] count the number of unique issue areas
un_votes$issue |>
  unique() |> 
  length()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = un_votes, mapping = aes(x = percent_yes)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# Error in code if "+" is omitted and pipe is used instead
# ggplot(data = un_votes, mapping = aes(x = percent_yes)) %>% 
  # geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# pipe the plot function to dataset as below
un_votes |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = percent_yes)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```

```{r}
country_list <- c("United States", "China", "Mexico", "Turkey")
```

```{r}
un_votes |> # take the dataset
  filter(
    country %in% country_list, # select rows for countries in from country_list
    issue %in% c("Human rights") # select cases for human rights votes
  ) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("% of votes that are 'Yes'") +
  scale_color_scico_d(palette = "berlin") + # adjust color
  theme_minimal() + # change the appearance
  theme(legend.position = "top") # change legend position
```

```{r}
un_votes |> # take the dataset
  filter(
    country %in% c("Italy", "France"), # select the countries to work with
    votes > 5 # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(
    x = year, # over horizontal axis
    y = percent_yes, # over vertical axis
    color = country
  )) +
  geom_point() + # add points
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) + # add trend line
  facet_wrap(~issue) + # split by issue
  labs(
    title = "Share of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
    subtitle = "1946 to 2019",
    y = "% Yes Votes",
    x = "Year",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  scale_color_scico_d(palette = "berlin") + # adjust color
  theme_minimal() + # change the appearance
  theme(legend.position = "top") # change legend position
```
